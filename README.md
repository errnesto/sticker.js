sticker.js
==========

A very simple and short script that makes websites snap to given elements

The script looks for elements with the class sticker and makes the page snap to those.
It also sets the hash to the name of the id of the element. And jumps to the element when its id 
is given in the url on load.

I built this for my website – now I used it on an other one so I made it interchangeble -> why not upload it on github…
